            <h2>Description</h2>
            <p>Our main goal with the following visualizations is to raise awareness about disasters affecting the world, focusing on both natural phenomena like earthquakes and technological mishaps such as industrial accidents. Especially, we want to shed light on such events affecting the world negatively, that fortunate people living in less affected areas might not fully understand the scale of. By fostering heightened awareness, our goal is to inspire greater humanitarian aid donations and support for post-disaster reconstruction efforts.</p>
    
            <h3>Data</h3>
            <p>We have selected the <a href="https://www.emdat.be/">Emergency Events Database (EM-DAT)</a> for our analysis. This database encompasses records of over 26,000 mass disasters worldwide spanning from 1900 to the present day. Established in 1988 through collaboration between the Centre for Research on the Epidemiology of Disasters (CRED) and the World Health Organization (WHO), EM-DAT consolidates data from diverse sources including UN agencies, non-governmental organisations, and research institutes. CRED, affiliated with the University of Louvain and supported by the United States Agency for International Development (USAID), upholds the data's credibility and reliability.</p>
            <p>It is worth noting that events predating 2000 are categorised as <em>"Historic"</em> by CRED and may exhibit a lower level of quality. This phenomenon, termed <em>time bias</em>, is elucidated further <a href="https://doc.emdat.be/docs/known-issues-and-limitations/specific-biases/#time-bias">here</a>.</p>
            <p>CRED defines a disaster as <em>“a situation or event that overwhelms local capacity, necessitating a request at the national or international level for external assistance; it is an unforeseen and often sudden event that causes great damage, destruction and human suffering.”</em> The disasters in this dataset meet at least one of the following criteria:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>10 or more reported deaths</li>
                <li>100 or more people affected</li>
                <li>Declaration of a state of emergency</li>
                <li>Call for international assistance</li>
            </ul>

            <div id="spike-map" style="margin-bottom: 20px;">
                <h3>Spike Map of Disasters across Time</h3>
                <p>Let's begin by exploring the big picture. This initial visualization dynamically illustrates the magnitude of historical disasters on a global scale. Each disaster will appear over time, represented by spikes that vary in length according to the severity of the event, such as the total number of deaths or the economic damage caused provoked by disaster. You can adjust the display criteria using the toggle bar below the spike legend.</p>    
                <p>Each spike is color-coded according to its disaster subgroup. When you start the visualization with the play button in the bottom left corner, it will display disasters from 1900 to the present day, demonstrating how disasters despite our will have persistently accompanied humanity.
                    You can pause the visualization at any time. If you're curious about a specific disaster, hover your mouse over the spike to see more information, such as the disaster type and the country where it occurred. This feature is especially useful if you're unfamiliar with geography or smaller countries
                    </p>
                <p>If you want to focus on a specific region, you can zoom within the map while maintaining accurate references with as the values of the spike legend will dynamically adapt.
                    This approach provides a preliminary glimpse into the historical significance and geographical diversity of disasters, helping you visualize and explore with a better understanding for future visualizations.
                    </p>
                <p><strong>Important Note:</strong> Data on disasters can be complex and sensitive, often leading to incomplete datasets. For this visualization, we were only able to retrieve 60% of the geo-coordinates, and not all disasters have complete information across all types of magnitude. Consequently, some disasters may not appear, or may disappear, as you change the magnitude variable.</p>

                <h3>Dynamic Bubble Chart Showing Yearly Impact of Natural Disasters</h3>
                <p>Now that we have explored the geographic spread of disasters, let's delve into their impact over the years. Below, you will find a dynamic bubble chart that updates annually, illustrating the human and economic toll of various natural disasters.</p>
                <p>The y-axis represents the number of deaths caused by these disasters, while the x-axis shows the total financial damage, adjusted to thousands of US dollars. Each bubble's size corresponds to the number of people affected. The bubbles are color-coded to differentiate between types of natural disasters, such as earthquakes, floods, storms, and more.</p>
                <p>This visualization provides a comprehensive view of the cumulative impact of each disaster type over time, allowing us to observe trends and patterns. By tracking these changes, we can better understand the evolving nature of global natural disasters and their consequences.</p>
                <p>When you feel ready, hit the play button below the diagram to watch the data progress year by year, offering a historical perspective on the effects of natural catastrophes.</p>

                <h3>Cumulative Race Chart Tracking Disaster Impact</h3>
                <p>
                    Now that we have explored the impact of natural disasters over the years, let's shift our focus to a dynamic race chart that highlights the accumulation of various disaster-related variables.
                </p>
                <p>
                    This race chart updates over time, showcasing the cumulative totals for your chosen variable, such as total damages, total deaths, or total affected individuals. The bars expand to reflect the growing numbers as each disaster is accounted for up to the year 2024.
                </p>
                <p>
                    You can customize the chart to display data by disaster subgroup or by country. When selecting disaster subgroups, the bars represent the accumulation of your chosen variable for specific types of disasters, such as ground movement, drought, or tropical cyclones. If you choose to view by country, the bars will show the cumulative impact of all disasters within each country.
                </p>
                <p>
                    This visualization provides a compelling way to compare and contrast the effects of different disasters or the overall impact on various countries. By observing these changes, we gain a deeper understanding of how different regions have been affected and how different types of disasters have contributed to the total impact over time.

                <h3>World Choropleth Disasters Inequalities</h3>
                <p>Now that we've explored the dynamics of disasters over time, let's shift our focus to the differences between countries. Our final visualization features a choropleth map that provides a clear visual representation of dynamic disasters across countries.
                    <br>The primary aim is to highlight inequalities by displaying metrics such as the percentage of international aid requests (appeals) and declarations of state of emergency per disaster within the Aid Category view. This allows us to observe how different countries respond to disasters.
                    </p>
                <p>For a more refined analysis, you can set minimum thresholds for disaster magnitudes using the filter button in the top left corner. This feature enables you to focus on significant events, effectively filtering out frequent but low-impact disasters. By exploring these dynamics, you can see how various variables impact conclusions, illuminating regional disparities and inequalities.</p>
                <p>If you switch the view to the Disaster Subgroup, you can observe how different types of disasters affect each country. For example, if you examine the biological subgroup, you will notice that a certain region of the world is more frequently affected for this type of disasters than others.</p>
                <p><strong>OFDA/BHA Response:</strong> Correspond to whether or not the (former) Office of US Foreign Disaster Assistance (OFDA) or the Bureau of Humanitarian Assistance (BHA) responded to the disaster.</p>
                <p><strong>Important Note:</strong> As highlighted in the initial visualization, not all disasters have complete information for all types of magnitude. Therefore, setting thresholds for specific variables may automatically exclude certain disasters with missing values, complicating comparisons and potentially introducing biases. Additionally, it is important to acknowledge that due to incomplete or inaccurate data, disasters, especially in less developed countries, might be underrepresented as they may lack the infrastructure to accurately record and report disaster data. </p>
